\begin{abstract}
Knowledge workers face many challenges as they work: work is fragmented, disruptions are constant, tasks are complex, and work hours can be long. These challenges make it difficult for a knowledge worker to stay focused, impacting the quality of work performed and productivity. Biometric sensors make it possible to continuously monitor human aspects, such as focus, awakeness and stress providing opportunities to help knowledge workers combat workplace challenges. We investigate how biometric measures, such as heart rate, respiration rate, and galvanic skin response, can be used to create a machine learning model able to accurately predict stress, awakeness, and focus levels. In a field study with 14 professionals over an eight-week period we collected and compared biometric and self-reporting data. Our results show that, with only a few days of self-reporting data, biometrics can be used to predict the level of stress, focus, and awakeness of operators.



%In certain collaborative work environments, particularly in control rooms, workers' performance can have an out-sized impact on outcomes. A sleepy factory operator that misses early warnings could lose millions of dollars due to a process shutdown; a stressed mining operator that mistakenly dispatches two underground trucks to the same location could cause a deadly crash. In these constantly evolving work environments being able to monitor operators' stress, awakeness, and focus level is important not only to identify issues that need immediate attention, but also to ensure an optimal work environment for these high-stakes workers. Typically, a person's alertness levels are acquired via self-reporting. Unfortunately, this causes frequent interruptions and even impacts the very measures it seeks to measure, such as focus. To avoid these issues we automatically collected biometrics such as heart rate, respiration rate, and galvanic skin response, and used them to create a machine learning model able to accurately predict stress, awakeness, and focus levels. In a field study with fourteen professionals over an eight-week period we collected and compared biometric and self-reporting data. Our results show that, with only a few days of self-reporting data, biometrics can be used to predict the level of stress, focus, and awakeness of operators.
