\begin{abstract}
Knowledge workers face many challenges in the workplace: work is 
fragmented, disruptions are constant, tasks are complex, and work hours can be 
long. These challenges can impact knowledge workers' stress, focus and awakeness, and in turn their interaction with the digital environment, the quality of work 
performed and their productivity in general. We report on a field study with 14
knowledge workers over an eight-week period in which we investigated, using
experience sampling, how the workers experience stress over time. During this field study, we also collected biometric data, which we then used to investigate if it is possible to predict such productivity-related indicators as stress, focus and awakeness, in the moment.
We observed and report on various trends in knowledge worker stress levels
over several weeks and show that machine learning models can be built to
predict stress, focus and awakeness from biometric data.

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this
% for more info: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf
%
% Note that in a perfect world balance wants to be in the first
% column of the last page.
%
% If balance doesn't work for you, you can remove that and
% hard-code a column break into the bbl file right before you
% submit:
%
% http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2149854/how-to-manually-equalize-columns-
% in-an-ieee-paper-if-using-bibtex
%
% Or, just remove \balance and give up on balancing the last page.
