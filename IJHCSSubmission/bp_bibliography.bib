	Abstract = {This paper presents a general statistical methodology for the analysis of multivariate categorical data arising from observer reliability studies. The procedure essentially involves the construction of functions of the observed proportions which are directed at the extent to which the observers agree among themselves and the construction of test statistics for hypotheses involving these functions. Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics. These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature.},

Quantification and interpretation of heart rate variability, however, remain complex issues and are fraught with pitfalls. The present report (a) examines the physiological origins and mechanisms of heart rate variability, (b) considers quantitative approaches to measurement, and (c) highlights important caveats in the interpretation of heart rate variability. Summary guidelines for research in this area are outlined, and suggestions and prospects for future developments are considered.},

@article{Veltman1998,
	Abstract = {The sensitivity of physiological measures to mental workload was investigated in a flight simulator. Twelve pilots had to fly through a tunnel with varying levels of difficulty. Additionally, they had to perform a memory task with four levels of difficulty. The easiest memory task was combined with the easiest tunnel task and the most difficult memory task with the most difficult tunnel task. Between the tunnel tasks, subjects had to fly a pursuit task in which a target jet had to be followed. Rest periods before and after the experiment were used as a baseline for the physiological measures. Mental workload was measured with heart period, continuous blood pressure, respiration and eye blinks. Several respiratory parameters, heart rate variability, blood pressure variability and the gain between systolic blood pressure and heart period (modulus) were scored. All measures showed differences between rest and flight, and between the pursuit and the tunnel task. Only heart period was sensitive to difficulty levels in the tunnel task. Heart rate variability increased when respiratory activity around 0.10 Hz increased, which occurred often. The modulus was hardly influenced by respiration and therefore appears to be a better measure than heart rate variability. Among the respiratory parameters, the duration of a respiratory cycle was the most sensitive to changes in workload. The time in between two successive eye blinks (blink interval) increased and the blink duration decreased as more visual information had to be processed. Increasing the difficulty of the memory task led to a decrement in blink interval, probably caused by subvocal activity during rehearsal of target letters. The data show that physiological measures are sensitive to mental effort, whereas rating scales are sensitive to both mental effort and task difficulty.},

To control for confounding variables Mantel-Haenszel summary risk estimates were used. Employees who expended more than 3.0 Kcal/kg???1 ?? day???1 in physical activity during leisure time were 0.78 and 0.62 times less likely to have moderate and high perceived stress, respectively. Working adults participating in moderate amounts of these activities have about half the rate of perceived stress as nonparticipants.},

	abstract = {Most classifiers work well when the class distribution in the response variable of the dataset is well balanced. Problems arise when the dataset is imbalanced. This paper applied four methods: Oversampling, Undersampling, Bagging and Boosting in handling imbalanced datasets. The cardiac surgery dataset has a binary response variable (1 = Died, 0 = Alive). The sample size is 4976 cases with 4.2 \% (Died) and 95.8 \% (Alive) cases. {CART}, C5 and {CHAID} were chosen as the classifiers. In classification problems, the accuracy rate of the predictive model is not an appropriate measure when there is imbalanced problem due to the fact that it will be biased towards the majority class. Thus, the performance of the classifier is measured using sensitivity and precision Oversampling and undersampling are found to work well in improving the classification for the imbalanced dataset using decision tree. Meanwhile, boosting and bagging did not improve the Decision Tree performance.},

	abstract = {Due to the growing pace of life, stress became one of the major factors causing health problems. We have developed a framework for measuring stress in real-life conditions continuously and unobtrusively. In order to provide meaningful, useful and actionable information, we present stress information, derived from sensor measurements, in the context of person's activities. In this paper, we describe our framework, discuss how we address arising challenges and evaluate our approach on basis of the field studies we have conducted. The main results of the evaluation are that the results of long-term measurements of stress reveal people information about their behavioral patterns that they perceive as meaningful and useful, and trigger their ideas about behavioral changes necessary to achieve a better stress balance.},

	abstract = {Monitoring of cognitive and physical function is central to the care of people with or at risk for various health conditions, but existing solutions rely on intrusive methods that are inadequate for continuous tracking. Less intrusive techniques that facilitate more accurate and frequent monitoring of the status of cognitive or physical function become increasingly desirable as the population ages and lifespan increases. Since the number of seniors using computers continues to grow dramatically, a method that exploits normal daily computer interactions is attractive. This research explores the possibility of detecting cognitive and physical stress by monitoring keyboard interactions with the eventual goal of detecting acute or gradual changes in cognitive and physical function. Researchers have already attributed a certain amount of variability and “drift” in an individual's typing pattern to situational factors as well as stress, but this phenomenon has not been explored adequately. In an attempt to detect changes in typing associated with stress, this research analyzes keystroke and linguistic features of spontaneously generated text. Results show that it is possible to classify cognitive and physical stress conditions relative to non-stress conditions based on keystroke and linguistic features with accuracy rates comparable to those currently obtained using affective computing methods. The proposed approach is attractive because it requires no additional hardware, is unobtrusive, is adaptable to individual users, and is of very low cost. This research demonstrates the potential of exploiting continuous monitoring of keyboard interactions to support the early detection of changes in cognitive and physical function.},
